# So... 

I've started to benchmark stuff and no-overhead has no cost at most of the languages..._(now)_
**So there is has no reason to keep going on this. ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)**

On 3th december I lost myself and started again to validate this, cuz i took a look at
c++ functions template and realized that the way I was trying to "abstract" things was
neither valid or the real propose for what rust calls "No abstraction cost".
* So, since the proposal stands over things like type abstractions as Generics not small ones that could be just linked as an internal binding to C/C++ function as .map(), etc I'll do some stuff?
